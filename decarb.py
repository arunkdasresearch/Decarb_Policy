st.title("Adam Bauer - The Timing Versus Allocation Trade-off in Politically Constrained Climate Policies")

# Acknowledgment and Research Impact
st.markdown("""
This research is based on the work of Adam Bauer at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, in collaboration with St√©phane Hallegatte and Florent McIsaac at the World Bank. Their study examines the delicate balance between optimal timing of climate action and the allocation of decarbonization efforts across economic sectors. 

For more details, visit [Adam Bauer's Website](http://ambauer.com) or view the webinar discussion on this research [here](https://e-axes.org/webinar/the-timing-versus-allocation-trade-off-in-politically-constrained-climate-policies/).

As the world navigates the urgency of climate change, policymakers must decide not only **when** to act but also **where** to focus their efforts. Poorly timed or misallocated policies can lead to wasted investments, unintended economic consequences, and missed opportunities to curb emissions effectively. This work provides a crucial framework for evaluating policy pathways, helping decision-makers strike the right balance between cost, feasibility, and long-term impact.
